### [Gephi](https://gephi.github.io/)
[Download from here](https://gephi.github.io/users/download/). Then make sure you install all the available updates first: Select `Tools>Plugins` and `Check for updates`.

If you had a previous installation of Gephi on a Mac, you find find that the launch freezes at "Opening Main Window." If so, in **Finder** select `Go>Go to folder` and navigate to `/Users/YourUserName/Library/Application Support`, substituting your own user name for `YourUserName`. Delete the old Gephi folder.
