Follow the links to download for your operating system from [here](http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html). Windows installation is straightforward. Mac users will find themselves [here](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis), and will first need to follow the links under the QGIS Standard heading to download and install the two requirements: GDAL and Matplotlib; then download and install QGIS itself.

### [Gephi](https://gephi.github.io/)
[Download from here](https://gephi.github.io/users/download/). If you had a previous installation of Gephi on a Mac, you find find that the launch freezes at "Opening Main Window." If so, in **Finder** select `Go>Go to folder` and navigate to `/Users/YourUserName/Library/Application Support`, substituting your own user name for `YourUserName`. Delete the old Gephi folder.
